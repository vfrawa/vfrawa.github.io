I'm extremely extroverted and I like making jokes about everything. My ESFP personality and my giant brain combined with a bit of ADHD make it so I leave everything till the last minute and still end up doing better than all of the tryhards. I've also sold my soul to a work at a high frequency crypto trading company as a trader so going to campus on a daily basis is kind of a big nono for me. I like to start my day by going for breakfast and discussing business ideas with someone. Then continue with playing basketball or going snowboarding, afterwards I'll go for playing the guitar, looking at tickets to Art Basel, watching andrew tate tiktoks.

It has lead me to take a large interest in the culture as well, with everything from the food and folk customs to anime and Vtubers. ";;

I also enjoy training, especially jogging. I believe that one should work on both the body and the mind in order to realize ones true capabilities (studies have also shown that mental capacity increases if one trains). Thus, I'm currently doing a mix of strength training, jogging, flexibility and handstand practice in order to make sure I stay in shape.;;
;;
I've always had a fondness for video games as well. In fact, they are what lead me to have an interest in pursuing programming and visualisation here at KTH. Thus, the side of visualization/graphics that I am the most interested in is computer graphics, but I'm hoping that this course will be a lot of fun as well!;;

"I've been trying to get into the artistic side of things too recently. I'm mostly doing 3D modeling but I've dabbled in drawing as well.

"1/17/2023 18:10:31,Ishi,""I am '5th' year student at KTH and a first year student in the master's program of computer science.  I have quite a lot of different interest / hobbies, perhaps to many as I have found it difficult to focus enough on any single interest to gain any particularly notable knowledge and / or skill within it. One of my strongest interest / hobbies is reading, fiction in particular and especially fantasy, though I enjoy reading other genres as well. I'm also very interested in technology in general, especially computers and other personal electronics but also just technology in general (transportation technologies, energy infrastructure, etc). I'm mostly very uninterested in sports though I love scuba diving, if that can really be considered a sport. I also used to practice sailing but quite several years ago, not so much because I lost interest but rather because I felt it took too much time. Another thing I really like is traveling, something I have been fortunate to be able to do quite a lot. Also, an interest I like to combine with my interest in traveling is photography, something I'm generally interested in but I especially like taking travel photos. As a finale note, related to my travel interest, one of my favourite places I have visited is Japan, a country I'm greatly interested in and would very much like to return to in the future";" This is especially the case since I have a number of friends in Japan and have also spent quite some time studying Japanese."",2,3,5,2,6,5,2,3,3,8,6,4";
